// uses, just filled in from the device instead of typed in. Re-running
// this on every sync is deliberate and harmless (it's an upsert): it
// catches up a challenge someone joined after it started, or picks back
// up correctly after a few days of not opening the app, without a
// separate "first ever sync" code path. Which number depends on what
// this challenge is scored on: a plain step count, or distance summed
// from logged workouts. 'gps_distance' trusts WorkoutSample.isOutdoor
// when a platform provides it (iOS, from HealthKit's own workout
// metadata) and only falls back to guessing from the workout's name
// when it doesn't (Android, or an iOS workout with no indoor/outdoor
// metadata at all) — that fallback still means a treadmill session or a
// phone-in-a-drawer walk can slip through if its name happens to match,
// a real limitation on the platforms/workouts that don't carry the real
// signal, not a hidden bug.

// progress used to only ever reach the server as a side effect of
// opening that exact challenge's own detail screen, so a participant
// who joined but never opened it individually stayed at 0 forever
